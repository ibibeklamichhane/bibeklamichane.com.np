# Introduction

Starting something new can be a confusing time, especially when you're eager to begin but can't find a reference or tutorial to start from scratch. In this guide, we'll take you through the process of creating a "Hello World" React app to help you get started.

## Requirements

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js installed. If you haven't already, you can [install Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/).

# Creating the App

Now that we have our environment set up, let's create our React app. We'll name this project 'firstapp'.
